## Secure, simple and fast PDF encryption PWA.

For some reason, most PDF software requires payment to perform encryption, and most websites require an account or uploading to the server. Turns out you can just do it all client-side in JavaScript, so I made a PWA that works offline. It even has advanced security permissions support!
